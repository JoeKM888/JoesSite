	 <br>Man to pianist after a concert:
	 <br><q>I'd give my life to be able to play like that!</q>
	 <br>Ignance Paderewski's reply:
	 <br><q>I did!</q>
	 <hr>
	 <blockquote>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br>
	 <br>It is our light, not our dark, that most frightens us.<br>
	 <br>We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be?<br>
	 <br>You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. We are born to manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us, it's in everyone. And as we let our light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.</blockquote>

	 <blockquote>It would be one thing if you were a couch potato sitting in front of the TV all day, frankly in my business (advertising) we need people like that, but to deliberately over-educate yourself out of all possibility of useful employment is just disgraceful!</blockquote>

	 <p>Nationality: Australian</p>
	 <p>Cultural background: On my mother's side I am 5th generation Australian. My dad was born in Malaysia but is culturally Sri Lankan. I have been exposed to Tamil Sri Lankan culture but I usually identify as white Australian, unless I am somewhere like one of my cousins' (on my dad's side) weddings.</p>
	 <p>Education: I completed my HSC, then a Diploma of Ministry, then a Certificate III in Business Administration, then several other TAFE certificates, then 89% of a Bachelor of Engineering, Mechanical.</p>
	 <p>Languages: English is my first language. I also speak a bit of French, although I've forgotten most of what I knew. In high school I learend Indonesian and German but that was a long time ago.</p>
	 <p>Interesting facts: Music is my lifeblood. Trumpet was my first instrument, guitar or bass are my main ones, and I can play keyboards, drums, didgeridoo and a couple of other things to a small degree (ok, very small in the case of didgeridoo and violin).</p>
