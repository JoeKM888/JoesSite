	<h2>Where did I start?</h2>
	<p>I first became interested in programming when I had to do an assignment on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a> in year 9 in high school, which led to my talking my parents into buying me a <a href="https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/system-80/hardware_s80.htm" target="_blank">Dick Smith System 80</a> with 16k RAM and an audio tape drive. I started programming in BASIC on it, writing various games and working on one in particular that helped me learn about subroutines.</p>

	<p>I did a course in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Pascal</a> in 1982 and started a degree in Mechanical Engineering at the <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au">University of Technology</a>, Sydney (then the NSW Institute of Technology) in 1984 where I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a> and dabbled in some other programming languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfor" target="_blank">Ratfor</a>, <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Z80_Assembly" target="_blank">Z80 Assembly code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Forth</a>). I had to withdraw from the course before I finished. In 2010 I had another go at Mechanical Engineering, at <a href="http://sydney.edu.au" target="_blank">Sydney University</a> this time. In first semester I did Engineering Computing which covered <a href="https://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank">Matlab</a>. September last year I had to withdraw from the course having completed 89% of it. I have some experience in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> and had a web site which made use of HTML &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">CSS</a> but that is gone now. I also started a course on Udemy in writing applications for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS" target="_blank">iOS</a>, but I didnâ€™t complete it as I prioritised my uni. studies.</p>

	<p>I love programming and get quite carried away while writing code. I would like to work re-writing software to make it more accessible to people with disabilities as a free-lancer. I probably should have gotten back into programming a long time ago but I used to be worried about how obsessive I got programming instead of realising that meant it was the ideal thing to do for a living. This is what prompted me to enroll at <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au" target="_blank">RMIT</a>.</p>

	<p>I hope to learn how to program in a modern language on modern hardware and more about web design. I also hope to learn more about making programs and sites accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
