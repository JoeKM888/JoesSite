		<h2>Where did I start?</h2>
		
		<p>I first became interested in programming when I had to do an assignment on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" target="_blank"><abbr title="Beginners All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</abbr></a> in year 9 in high school, which led to my talking my parents into buying me a <a href="https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/system-80/hardware_s80.htm" target="_blank">Dick Smith System 80</a> with 16<abbr title="kilo Byte">kB</abbr> <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> and an audio tape drive. I started programming in <abbr title="Beginners All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</abbr> on it, writing various games and working on one in particular that helped me learn about subroutines.</p>
		
		<p>In 1982 I finished a year student exchange program in the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> where I studied <abbr title="Beginners All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</abbr> and got 100%. I did a course in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Pascal</a> in 1983 and started a degree in Mechanical Engineering at the <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au" target="_blank">University of Technology, Sydney</a> (<abbr title="University of Technology, Sydney">UTS</abbr>, then the NSW Institute of Technology) in 1984 where I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran" target="_blank">Fortran</a> and dabbled in some other programming languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfor" target="_blank">Ratfor</a>, <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Z80_Assembly" target="_blank">Z80 Assembly code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Forth</a>). I had to withdraw from the course before I finished. In 2010 I had another go at Mechanical Engineering, at <a href="http://sydney.edu.au" target="_blank">Sydney University</a> this time. In first semester I did Engineering Computing which covered <a href="https://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank">Matlab</a>. September last year I had to withdraw from the course having completed 89% of it. I have some experience in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank"><abbr title="Hyper Text Mark up Language">HTML</abbr></a> and had a web site which made use of <abbr title="Hyper Text Mark up Language">HTML</abbr> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></a> but that is gone now. I also started a course on Udemy in writing applications for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS" target="_blank"><abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr></a>, but I didn't complete it as I prioritised my university studies.</p>

		<p>I love programming and get quite carried away while writing code. I would like to work re-writing software to make it more accessible to people with disabilities as a free-lancer. I probably should have gotten back into programming a long time ago but I used to be worried about how obsessive I got programming instead of realising that meant it was the ideal thing to do for a living. This is what prompted me to enrol at <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au" target="_blank"><abbr title="Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology">RMIT</abbr></a>.</p>
		
		<p>I hope to learn how to program in a modern language on modern hardware and more about web design. Specifically I hope to develop a good knowledge of Java and have some experience in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/swift/" target="_blank">Swift</a> (building upon what I already know) and Linux as well as developing my <abbr title="Hyper Text Mark up Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">Javascript</a> skills. I also hope to learn more about making programs and sites accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
