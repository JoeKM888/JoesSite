		<h2>Gaspard</h2>
		
		<p>I was unable to find any job adverts online that were remotely like my ideal job, so I created a fictional job advert for a real company:</p>
		
		<div id=centre>
		<img src="images/Ad.jpg" width="720" height="316" alt="Captiv iOS developer ad (fake)" />
		</div>
		
		<p><a href="https://captiv.eu" target="_blank">Captiv</a>. Captiv is a small French company of 11 people (or at least that's the <a href="https://www.mistergaspard.com" target="_blank">Gaspard</a> team) making <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> products, including for the disability services market. It's products include a sensor mat for wheelchairs that communicates with an iPhone to warn when you are in danger of developing a bedsore and 5 other functions (called Gaspard) and an temperature/humidity/pressure sensor that communicates with your iPhone.</p>
		
		<p>Position: Captiv is looking for experienced <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr> Mobile Devs with a passion for quality, a passion for innovation, and a passion to learn. You would be working on our Gaspard product. This is my ideal job as my desire is to work making life richer for people with disabilities.</p>
		
		<p>A few years experience with <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr> and programming in Swift. You must be able to demonstrate several <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr> apps you have written. The ideal applicant will have fluent French. Some experience in engineering and web design would be a bonus.</p>
		
		<p>I have basic French (formerly intermediate) and several months experience writing apps for <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr> in Swift. I have 89% of an engineering degree and basic web design capabilities. I'm practicing my French once a week with a friend and at some point I'll take a 2 week holiday to Vanuatu for an immersive French experience once my French is good enough (it involves staying with a family who don't speak English and is subsidised by the French government).</p>
		
		<p>I plan on taking the iPhone Software Engineering elective as part of my Bachelor of <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>, as well as Further Programming, Programming Principles 2A and Object-Oriented Programming in C++, and taking UNIX System Administration as a free elective and a 2nd semester French subject as my other elective. I plan on working on making some abandonware games accessible to people with disabilities as well as making them available to modern <abbr title="Operating Systems">OSs</abbr>, <abbr title="Mac Operating System">MacOS</abbr>, <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr>, Windows and Linux, as projects while I complete my degree.</p>
