		<h2>Gaspard</h2>
		
		<p>I was unable to find any job adverts online that were remotely like my ideal job, so I created a fictional job advert for a real company:</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://captiv.eu" target="_blank">Captiv</a>. Captiv is a small French company of 11 people (or at least that's the <a href="https://www.mistergaspard.com" target="_blank">Gaspard</a> team) making IT products, including for the disability services market. It's products include a sensor mat for wheelchairs that communicates with an iPhone to warn when you are in danger of developing a bedsore (called Gaspard) and an temperature/humidity/pressure sensor that communicates with your iPhone.</p>
		
		<p>Position: iPhone programmer for the Gaspard product. This is my ideal job as my desire is to work making life richer for people with disabilities.</p>
		
		<p>A few years experience with iOS and programming in Swift. You must be able to demonstrate several iOS apps you have written. The ideal applicant will have fluent French. Some experience in engineering and web design would be a bonus.</p>
		
		<p>I have basic French (formerly intermediate) and several months experience writing apps for iOS in Swift. I have 89% of an engineering degree and basic web design capabilities. I'm practicing my French once a week with a friend and at some point I'll take a 2 week holiday to Vanuatu for an immersive French experience once my French is good enough (it involves staying with a family who don't speak English and is subsidised by the French government).</p>
		
		<p>I plan on taking the iPhone Software Engineering elective as part of my Bachelor of IT, as well as Further Programming, Programming Principles 2A and Object-Oriented Programming in C++, and taking UNIX System Administration as a free elective and a 2nd semester French subject as my other elective. I plan on working on making some abandonware games accessible to people with disabilities as well as making them available to modern OSs, MacOS, iOS, Windows and Linux, as projects while I complete my degree.</p>
