		<h2>Three tests</h2>
		
		<h3>Meyers-Briggs Test</h3>

		<p>ESTJs make up about 7% of the population.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Decisive, efficient, and systematic</li>
			<li>Dedicated and responsible</li>
			<li>Strong-willed</li>
			<li>Natural leaders</li>
			<li>Organized and reliable</li>

			<li>Committed, trustworthy, and honest</li>
			<li>Enthusiastic, outgoing, and friendly</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I'm not sure how helpful this test really is. While I am <q>trustworthy, and honest,</q> and usually <q>committed,</q> especially in this degree, the world would be in great trouble if this only applied to 7% of the population, and I'm not convinced it applies to all 7% of the population that are ESTJs.</p>
		
		<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
	
		<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml</a>
		
		<p>What's Your Learning Style? The Results</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		<p>Your Scores:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Auditory: 60%</li>
			<li>Visual: 25%</li>
			<li>Tactile: 15%</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>You are an Auditory learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.</p>
		
		<h4>Auditory</h4>
		
		<p>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.</p>
		
		<p>As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</p>
		
		<p>Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Sit where you can hear.</li>
			<li>Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.</li>
			<li>Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.</li>
			<li>Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.</li>
			<li>Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.</li>
			<li>Have test questions read to you out loud.</li>
			<li>Study new material by reading it out loud.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.</p>

		<p>Once again, I've been sitting up the front of classrooms and lecture halls since the early years of high school. What started initially as a way to compensate for undiagnosed short sightedness has become a habit as I've become more aware of the benefits, such as most students who sit up the front are pretty keen and less likely to talk through the lecture.</p>
		
		<h3>IQ Test</h3>
	
		<a href="https://intellitest.me/en/knowledge/FKEVK/start?gclid=CjwKCAjwt-L2BRA_EiwAacX32ZGDJ42BbvUPAbsiDCjgF3JoYrXkph9bF-tWF1AR5aZmPr57oNZvGBoCgiMQAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=9910358&utm_content=free+iq+test+online&utm_medium=gad_as-1_us-uk-ca-au_pho-tab-web_40q_iq_int&utm_source=62" target="_blank">https://intellitest.me/en/knowledge/FKEVK/start?gclid=CjwKCAjwt-L2BRA_EiwAacX32ZGDJ42BbvUPAbsiDCjgF3JoYrXkph9bF-tWF1AR5aZmPr57oNZvGBoCgiMQAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=9910358&utm_content=free+iq+test+online&utm_medium=gad_as-1_us-uk-ca-au_pho-tab-web_40q_iq_int&utm_source=62</a>
		<blockquote>
		<h4>Your IQ score is 130</h4>
		
		<p>Congratulations, your IQ classification is gifted. People who score within the 120-140 range fall into the top 14% of our users. This means that your reasoning and overall mental agility place you above average.</p>
		
		<p>Your IQ classification is derived from the total score you achieved in the different areas of testing. These scores are totalled and then compared with the rest of our users. An average score is 100. Where you fall on the IQ scale is how you compare to all other users. In this case, that is above the average.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>When people make a big deal out of IQ scores I am reminded of an experiment one of my teachers was involved in while they were at university. A group of researchers came up with an IQ test aimed at African Americans living in Harlem, but they had made it too easy and the control group were getting scores of 180-240. When my teacher did it he got an IQ score of 40 in this test, and the highest in his class got 60. He had an IQ of 140 and the person who got 60 had an IQ of 160 in a regular IQ tests. Also if asked the question <q>which of these is not like the others</q> and you had a seal, a shark, an orca, and a tiger, a regular IQ test may well say the shark as it is not a mammal, or the tiger as it doesn't live in the water, but someone from a hunter gather society may say the seal as it is not a predator.</p>
		
		<h2>What this means for me and my group</h2>
		
		<h3>What it means for me</h3>
		
		<p>While I don't disagree with the description of myself that the Meyers-Briggs Test comes up with, I'm not sure how useful they are for someone who knows themself well. They may be helpful to someone hiring people who has to assess a lot of people they don't know quickly, or for a young person who doesn't know themself that well. It's pretty positive so I don't think it's a problem for job interviews if they test me. The learning style test doesn't really tell me anything I didn't already suspect. IQ tests suffer from problems of cultural bias, although this works in my favour as I am of the culture the tests are aimed at.</p>
		
		<h3>My behaviour in the group</h3>
		
		<p>For a group it indicates I should be an asset to them. Being organised and natural leader, combined with my experience with HTML and programming should make it easy for me to find people who would like to join forces. I hope to be able to help the team out a lot. Although my ESTJ profile says I'm a natural leader, this is not a position I gravitate towards as it takes a lot of work to do well. All the groups I've been in at university before didn't have a leader and just worked cooperatively anyway.</p>
		
		<h3>Forming a group</h3>
		
		<p>I hope to find a group with a few other people with some IT skills and one or two people who could do with a helping hand, without the IT background &amp;/or for whom English is not their first language. I hope to do very well in this subject so I would hope the majority of the group can all pull their weight easily, but I also hope to help others along the way.</p>
