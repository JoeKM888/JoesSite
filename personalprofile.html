	<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml</a>

	<p>What's Your Learning Style? The Results</p>
	<p>Your Scores:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Auditory: 60%</li>
		<li>Visual: 25%</li>
		<li>Tactile: 15%</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You are an Auditory learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.</p>
	<h4>Auditory</h4>
	<p>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.</p>
	<p>As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</p>
	<p>Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sit where you can hear.</li>
		<li>Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.</li>
		<li>Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.</li>
		<li>Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.</li>
		<li>Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.</li>
		<li>Have test questions read to you out loud.</li>
		<li>Study new material by reading it out loud.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.</p>
	
	<h3>IQ Test</h3>

	<h4>Your IQ score is 130</h4>

	<p>Congratulations, your IQ classification is gifted. People who score within the 120-140 range fall into the top 14% of our users. This means that your reasoning and overall mental agility place you above average.</p>
	<p>Your IQ classification is derived from the total score you achieved in the different areas of testing. These scores are totalled and then compared with the rest of our users. An average score is 100. Where you fall on the IQ scale is how you compare to all other users. In this case, that is above the average.</p>
	
	<h2>What this means for me and my group</h2>
	
	<h3>What it means for me</h3>
	
	<p>While I don't disagree with the description of myself that the Meyers-Briggs Test comes up with, I'm not sure how useful they are for someone who knows themself well. They may be helpful to someone hiring people who has to assess a lot of people they don't know quickly, or for a young person who doesn't know themself that well. It's pretty positive so I don't think it's a problem for job interviews if they test me. The learning style test doesn't really tell me anything I didn't already suspect. IQ tests suffer from problems of cultural bias, although this works in my favour as I am of the culture the tests are aimed at.</p>
	
	<h3>My behaviour in the group</h3>
	
	<p>For a group it indicates I should be an asset to them. Being organised and natural leader, combined with my experience with HTML and programming should make it easy for me to find people who would like to join forces. I hope to be able to help the team out a lot. Although my ESTJ profile says I'm a natural leader, this is not a position I gravitate towards as it takes a lot of work to do well. All the groups I've been in at university before didn't have a leader and just worked cooperatively anyway. </p>
	
	<h3>Forming a group</h3>
	
	<p>I hope to find a group with a few other people with some IT skills and one or two people who could do with a helping hand, without the IT background &/or for whom English is not their first language. I hope to do very well in this subject so I would hope the majority of the group can all pull their weight easily, but I also hope to help others along the way.</p>
