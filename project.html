		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>This project would be to get hold of the code for the shareware game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova" target="_blank">Escape Velocity (<abbr title="Escape Velocity">EV</abbr>) Nova</a>, and rewrite the code for modern operating systems and to make it more accessible to people with disabilities. The original game was distributed by the now defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosia_Software" target="_blank">Ambrosia Software</a> and last updated in 2011. The object would be to include the ability of the original game to be extensible through plugins, and to write a converter that would update plugins from the original game to be useable with the new game, including plugins written for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Override" target="_blank">Escape Velocity Override</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_(video_game)" target="_blank">Escape Velocity</a>, the predecessors of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova" target="_blank"><abbr title="Escape Velocity">EV</abbr> Nova</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		
		<p>I loved Escape Velocity, I paid the shareware fee and developed my own plugins for it. It was a brilliant game that could be played without combat if you wanted to, in which case it would have been purely a space trading game, although most of the missions and scenarios developed for it involved some kind of combat. In addition to bringing the game back for people were fans of it, plus those who could become fans, making it accessible for people with disabilities would open it up for a whole new audience many of whom have a lot of time on their hands and are not well catered to in the software market. Also it would be advertising for me as a programmer.</p>
		
		<h2>Description</h2>
		
		<p>I have contemplated this project for a number of years, however I didn't have the skills to implement it and I wasn't developing them because I feared becoming obsessed with programming. Now that I am developing those skills and completing it is a realistic goal, the original programmers of <abbr title="Escape Velocity">EV</abbr> Override have decided to rewrite the program <q>for Mac, Windows <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> and Linux.</q> [<a name="1">1</a>] They were unable to secure the cooperation of the programmers for the <abbr title="Escape Velocity">EV</abbr> Nova update as they felt they didn't want to release it at this time, which makes it extremely unlikely I would be able to get the code for <abbr title="Escape Velocity">EV</abbr> Nova from the original programmers.</p>
		
		<p>With this in mind, my project would be to contribute to their project by making their game significantly more accessible to people with disabilities and to make it available in <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr> and for Android, and thus make it available to a wider audience. They have said they don't plan to add anything to the game before the first release, which is scheduled for the middle of 2021, by which time I may or may not have the skills necessary to add the accessibility functionality I would like. After the first release they will be looking at adding functionality, by which time I may be ready to assist in adding accessibility options. I'm just about at the point where I could make any commands able to be operated from the keyboard now.</p>
		
		<p>I would be looking to make the game playable entirely from the keyboard, eg. for the visually disabled, and entirely from the mouse, eg. for those who can use a head pointer more easily than a keyboard such as some people with cerebral palsy. Also making it able to pass all text through a text-to-speech synthesiser, again for the visually disabled. It can already be played without sound making it suitable for the deaf. Making the options available while on a planet, space station or moon would be comparatively easy as these are mostly text screens and are not in real time. Making the combat, piracy, salvage and rescue, asteroid mining and other space based activities, which rely on visual feedback in real time, suitable for audio feedback alone would be another matter. One way around this is to introduce the option of having the computer take care of combat using simple <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>. Although it would be possible to make the <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> more effective than a human player, the object would be to make it slightly worse than an average human so players who have the option don't resort to <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> because it fights better than them. Perhaps an option to indicate you are visually impaired in the preferences making the <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> better for the player would be an idea, and just hope that it isn't used much by people who aren't. I'll have to pay attention when we get to <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> in this subject.</p>

		<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
		
		<p>A Mac Mini with 16<abbr title="Giga Byte">GB</abbr> <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> and a solid state main drive and associated hardware (monitor etc.) should be able to handle the Mac<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr> and Android programming. Hopefully a <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> laptop with 8<abbr title="Giga Byte">GB</abbr> <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> and a solid state main drive could handle the cross platform development for Windows and Linux. An iPhone to test it on a real life device, and an Android phone to do the same. Xcode could handle development for Mac<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> and <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr>. Perhaps Eclipse C++ IDE could be used for cross platform development to Windows. Android Software Development Kit (<abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr>) and Android Studio, free downloads and available for Mac and Windows, would enable Android development. That and an internet connection may be all the hardware and software that is required, which I already have (except the Eclipse C++ IDE, Android <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> and Android Studio software, but that is just a download away). It would probably be a good idea for me to pick up a 2nd <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> (desktop or laptop) to use for Linux, but I know it is possible to create a dual boot system on the laptop I have.</p>
		
		<h2>Skills Required</h2>
		
		<p>As a very minimum, <abbr title="iPhone Operating System">iOS</abbr> programming in Swift would be needed to bring the game to the iPhone and iPad. As Xcode now allows programs developed for the iPad to be converted to Mac<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, this may be all that is required to bring it to the Mac. To develop it for Windows would probably require a knowledge of C++. Android <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> uses Java, which I am learning now. Also a knowledge of Objective C would be required as this was the language the original program was written in. This would have to be self taught, but there is a plethora of help for this on the web. I hope to have these skills by the end of this degree by taking the right electives.</p>
		
		<h2>Outcome</h2>
		
		<p>The successful completion of this project would see the <abbr title="Escape Velocity">EV</abbr> Nova game available on Mac, iPhone, iPad, Windows, Android devices and Linux. It would see it and the plugins developed for it, <abbr title="Escape Velocity">EV</abbr> Override and the original <abbr title="Escape Velocity">EV</abbr> (including my own) accessible to people with visual disabilities and physical disabilities that make accessing a keyboard more difficult assuming they could use some sort of pointer, such as a head pointer. By the time I have completed this degree and developed these skills I will probably have learned more about accessibility and it may be accessible to others as well.</p>
