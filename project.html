	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>This project would be to get hold of the code for the shareware game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova" target="_blank">Escape Velocity (EV) Nova</a>, and rewrite the code for modern operating systems and to make it more accessible to people with disabilities. The original game was distributed by the now defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosia_Software" target="_blank">Ambrosia Software</a> and last updated in 2011. The object would be to include the ability of the original game to be extensible through plugins, and to write a converter that would update plugins from the original game to be useable with the new game, including plugins written for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Override" target="_blank">Escape Velocity Override</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_(video_game)" target="_blank">Escape Velocity</a>, the predecessors of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova" target="_blank">EV Nova</a>.</p>

	<h2>Motivation</h2>

	<p>I loved Escape Velocity, I paid the shareware fee and developed my own plugins for it. It was a brilliant game that could be played without combat if you wanted to, in which case it would have been purely a space trading game, although most of the missions and scenarios developed for it involved some kind of combat. In addition to bringing the game back for people were fans of it, plus those who could become fans, making it accessible for people with disabilities would open it up for a whole new audience many of whom have a lot of time on their hands and are not well catered to in the software market. Also it would be advertising for me as a programmer.</p>

	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>I have contemplated this project for a number of years, however I didn't have the skills to implement it and I wasn't developing them because I feared becoming obsessed with programming. Now that I am developing those skills and completing it is a realistic goal, the original programmers of EV Override have decided to rewrite the program 'for Mac, Windows PC and Linux.' [<a name="1">1</a>] They were unable to secure the cooperation of the programmers for the EV Nova update as they felt they didn't want to release it at this time, which makes it extremely unlikely I would be able to get the code from them.</p>

	<p>With this in mind, my project would be to contribute to their project by making their game significantly more accessible to people with disabilities, and thus make it available to a wider audience. They have said they don't plan to add anything to the project before the first release, which is scheduled for the middle of 2021, by which time I may or may not have the skills necessary to add the accessibility functionality I would like. After the first release they will be looking at adding functionality to the game, by which time I may be ready to assist in adding accessibility options.</p>

	<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

	<p>A Mac Mini with 16GB RAM and a solid state main drive and associated hardware (monitor, keyboard and mouse) should be able to handle the programming. Hopefully a PC laptop with 8GB RAM and a solid state main drive could handle the cross platform development. Xcode could handle development for MacOS and iOS. Perhaps Eclipse C++ IDE could be used for cross platform development to Windows. That and an internet connection may be all the hardware that is required, which I already have (except the Eclipse C++ IDE software, but that is just a download away).</p>

	<h2>Skills Required</h2>

	<p>As a very minimum, iOS programming in Swift would be needed to bring the game to the iPhone and iPad. As Xcode now allows programs developed for the iPad to be converted to MacOS, this may be all that is required to bring it to the Mac. To develop it for Windows would probably require a knowledge of C++. Also a knowledge of Objective C would be required as this was the language the original program was written in. I hope to have these skills by the end of this degree.</p>

	<h2>Outcome</h2>

	<p>The successful completion of this project would see the EV Nova game available on Mac, iPhone, iPad, Windows and Android devices and possibly Linux if I get back into that OS. It would see it and the plugins developed for it, EV Override and the original EV (including my own) accessible to people with visual disabilities and physical disabilities that make accessing a keyboard more difficult assuming they could use some sort of pointer, such as a head pointer. By the time I have completed this degree and developed these skills I will probably have learned more about accessibility and it may be accessible to others as well.</p>
