	<h2>Overview</h2>
	
	<p>This project would be to get hold of the code for the shareware game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova">Escape Velocity (EV) Nova</a>, and rewrite the code for modern operating systems and to make it more accessible to people with disabilities. The original game was distributed by the now defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosia_Software">Ambrosia Software</a> and last updated in 2011. The object would be to include the ability of the original game to be extensible through plugins, and to write a converter that would update plugins from the original game to be useable with the new game, including plugins written for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Override">Escape Velocity Override</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_(video_game)">Escape Velocity</a>, the predecessors of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova">EV Nova</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Motivation</h2>
	
	<p>I loved Escape Velocity, I paid the shareware fee and developed my own plugins for it. It was a brilliant game that could be played without combat if you wanted to, in which case it would have been purely a space trading game, although most of the missions and scenarios developed for it involved some kind of combat. In addition to bringing the game back for people were fans of it, plus those who could become fans, making it accessible for people with disabilities would open it up for a whole new audience many of whom have a lot of time on their hands and are not well catered to in the software market. Also it would be advertising for me as a programmer.</p>
	
	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
	
	<p>A Mac Mini with 16GB RAM and a solid state main drive and associated hardware (monitor, keyboard and mouse) should be able to handle the programming. Hopefully a PC laptop with 8GB RAM and a solid state main drive could handle the cross platform development. Xcode could handle development for MacOS and iOS. Perhaps Eclipse C++ IDE could be used for cross platform development to Windows. That and an internet connection may be all that is required.</p>
	
	<h2>Skills Required</h2>
	
	<p>As a very minimum, iOS programming in Swift would be needed to bring the game to the iPhone and iPad. As Xcode now allows programs developed for the iPad to be converted to MacOS, this may be all that is required to bring it to the Mac. To develop it for Windows would probably require a knowledge of C++.</p>
