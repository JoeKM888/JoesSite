	<br>Man to pianist after a concert:
	<br><q>I'd give my life to be able to play like that!</q>
	<br>Ignance Paderewski's reply:
	<br><q>I did!</q>
	<hr>
	<blockquote>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br>
	<br>It is our light, not our dark, that most frightens us.<br>
	<br>We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be?<br>
	<br>You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. We are born to manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us, it's in everyone. And as we let our light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>It would be one thing if you were a couch potato sitting in front of the TV all day, frankly in my business (advertising) we need people like that, but to deliberately over-educate yourself out of all possibility of useful employment is just disgraceful!</blockquote>

	<h2>Some information about me</h2>
<a name="testimony"><strong></strong></a>

	<p>I first became interested in programming when I had to do an assignment on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a> in year 9 in high school, which led to my talking my parents into buying me a <a href="https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/system-80/hardware_s80.htm" target="_blank">Dick Smith System 80</a> with 16k RAM and an audio tape drive. I started programming in 1979 in BASIC on it. I did a course in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Pascal</a> in 1982 and started a degree in Mechanical Engineering at the <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au">University of Technology</a>, Sydney (then the NSW Institute of Technology) in 1984 where I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a> and dabbled in some other programming languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfor" target="_blank">Ratfor</a>, <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Z80_Assembly" target="_blank">Z80 Assembly code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Forth</a>). I had to withdraw from the course before I finished. In 2010 I had another go at Mechanical Engineering, at <a href="http://sydney.edu.au" target="_blank">Sydney University</a> this time. In first semester I did Engineering Computing which covered <a href="https://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank">Matlab</a>. September last year I had to withdraw from the course having completed 89% of it. I have some experience in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> and had a web site which made use of HTML &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">CSS</a> but that is gone now. I also started a course on Udemy in writing applications for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS" target="_blank">iOS</a>, but I didnâ€™t complete it as I prioritised my uni. studies.</p>

	<p>I love programming and get quite carried away while doing writing code. I would like to work re-writing software to make it more accessible to people with disabilities as a free-lancer. I probably should have gotten back into programming a long time ago but I used to be worried about how obsessive I got programming instead of realising that meant it was the ideal thing to do for a living. This is what prompted me to enroll at <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au" target="_blank">RMIT</a>. I hope to learn how to program in a modern language on modern hardware and more about web design. I also hope to learn more about making programs and sites accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

	<p>Blessings,<br>
	Joe :-)</p>
